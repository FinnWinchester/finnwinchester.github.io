        <p>To have gotten this far since I left the university without knowing what was I going to do with my life until the same summer when I,
          <strong>eureka!</strong>, found what I really wanted to study.</p>
        <p>My small projects even though they don't have many downloads. I don't make them for people out there; I make them for myself so I can learn a little bit more.</p>
        <p>My will to learn everything that can be interesting to be learned. JS framework? Yes! .NET? No, thanks.</p>
