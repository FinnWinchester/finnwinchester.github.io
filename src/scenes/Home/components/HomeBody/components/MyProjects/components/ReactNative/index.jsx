        <p>Since I am learning ReactJS I wanted to test what React Native was and offered when developing hybrid apps. The master branch contains a simple Hello World. The 'fauna-test' contains more elaborated content. Link: <a href='https://github.com/FinnWinchester/React-Native-Testing' target='_blank'>React Native</a>.</p>
